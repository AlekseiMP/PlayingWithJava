# Workout Program

## Overview

My UD 3 is a simple Java application designed to help users manage and track their workouts. Users can add different exercises, record the number of sets and reps for each exercise, and view their workout history.

## Features

- Add new exercises to your workout plan
- Record sets and reps for each exercise
- View workout history
- Simple and user-friendly console interface

## Motivation

This project was created to provide a useful tool for fitness enthusiasts to track their workouts and progress. I have used similar programs in the past, so I wanted to try to design my own basic one.

### How to use

1. When prompted, enter the name of the exercise you want to add.
2. Input the number of sets and reps for the exercise.
3. View your workout history to see all recorded exercises and their details.
